IMPROVEMENTS: 1-> PRIORITY 2-> AVERAGE 3-> SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE


 1 ADD MORE LEGENDS:
    search input placeholder
    form feedback
    chart export example (example metadata)
    tsv or json export (add jsonlines format?)
    remove colors of tax explorer branches or add LEGENDS
    improve countries map (On the EBP instance, the “countries” map is a neat idea, but the “globe” explorer is hard to use, the zoom option is required to see small countries, especially in Europe, but it took me a while to find through trial and error. In addition, the “imagery” menu seems out of place: why the need for a “street map”, “Earth at night” etc. This 3D Earth display mode needs a bit more work, with some guidance added and some options disabled)
 2 countries map should be a leaflet heatmap, selecting a country should add a filter in the organism?
 1 add jbrowse legend
 1 instead of repetitive view in add button with dropdown (view in ena, view in NCBI and view blobtoolkit)
 1 instead of different related data buttons, add related data dropdown (related organism, biosample)
 2 API MULTI SELECT FIELDS LIKE MULTIPLE INSDC_STATUS
 2 JOBS UPDATE ASSEMBLY METADATA
 2 JOBS DISTINGUISH BETWEEN EXPERIMENT and READS TYPES
 2 REFACTOR FILTERS --> FILTERS + HITS -> SUBMIT FILTERS
 1 FRONT MODULARIZE APPS: MAIN APP, CMS, GENOME BROWSER, LANDING PAGE AT ROOT PATH
 1 FIX PAGINATION ISSUE IN (pinia stores are a problem between countries, tax explorer and data. Should add a selected taxon button)
 1 fix DOI DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PAPER AND GH (USE STATIC ONE)
 1 FIX GOAT SPREADSHEET UPLOAD ISSUES (some goat status is not updated)
 1 JBROWSE CREATE DEFAULT SESSION
2 USE YAML TO DEFINE JOBS
3 USE READ INSTEAD OF EXPERIMENTS?

MODULARIZE APP:

API

ADD GOAT STATUS AND INSDC STATUS DOCUMENTS, WITH TAXID AND TAXON LINEAGE

SHOUDL FRONT-END APPS BE CONFIGURATION AGNOSTIC?

CREATE CONFIGURATION WIZARD?? STORE CONFIGS IN DATABASE??

CMS --> PUBLISH CONTAINER IN DOCKERHUB -> INJECT VARIABLES AT RUNNING TIME
PORTAL --> more taxonomy explorer centered 
JBROWSE --> use url parameters to pass data (assembly, annotations, taxonomic lineage, assembly details) to genome browser
